# Umati Codebase

The Umati Codebase is suite of analysis code built in R and Python for purposes of studying the propagation of inflammatory speech online. It also represents the machine translation of the Umati methodology on factors for identifying dangerous speech in Kenya (The Susan Benesch Framework). The code suite is grouped into three main categories:

* Collection
* Tagger
